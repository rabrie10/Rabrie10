## 🚀 Snake Animation Setup

The snake animation is generated by a GitHub Actions workflow:

   - Daily at midnight UTC
   - Manual trigger via workflow_dispatch
   - On push to main branch

2. **What it does**:
   - Generates snake animation from your contribution graph
   - Creates both dark and light versions
   - Pushes to `output` branch

3. **To enable**:
   - Merge changes to main branch
   - Wait for first workflow run or trigger manually
   - Check Settings > Actions to ensure workflows are enabled
